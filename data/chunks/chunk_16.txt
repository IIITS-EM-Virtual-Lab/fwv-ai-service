Faraday's Law is one of the four Maxwell's equations, which form the foundation of classical electromagnetism. It describes how a changing magnetic field can induce an electric field, which is the principle behind electromagnetic induction. The general statement of Faraday's Law can be given in both integral and differential forms. Using Stokes' theorem, Faraday's Law in differential form is: 1. Stationary Loop in a Time-Varying Magnetic Field (Transformer EMF) In this case, the loop is fixed in space, but the magnetic field through it changes with time. According to Faraday's Law, this induces an EMF:
