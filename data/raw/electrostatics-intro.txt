Coulomb's Law describes the electrostatic interaction between electrically charged particles. It states that the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
Coulombs Law:Coulombs Law states that the force F between two point charges Q1 and Q2
Directly proportional to the product of the charges
Inversely proportional to the square of the distance R between them
where k is the proportionally constant whose value depends on the choice of system of units. In SI units charges are in coulombs (C), the distance R is in meters (m), and the force F is in newtons (N) so that. The constant is known as the permittivity of free space and has the value
Electric Field intensity E is the force that a unit positive charge experiences when placed in an electric field
For Q>0, the electric field intensity E is the direction of the force F and is measured in newtons per coulomb or volts per meter. The electric field intensity at point r due to a point charge located at r
For N point charges located at the electric field intensity at point r is obtained as
