A wave is a disturbance that propagates while carrying energy but not matter. Electromagnetic (EM) waves are transverse and can travel in free space without a material medium. Explore transverse EM waves (E–H–k), polarization, standing waves, longitudinal waves, and attenuation. A wave traveling in the +z direction is represented as: For a uniform plane electromagnetic wave in an isotropic medium: Superposition of equal-amplitude waves in opposite directions results in:
