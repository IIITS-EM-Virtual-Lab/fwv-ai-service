Electric Field at point P due to Electric Dipole (E) = (1.61, 0.00, 0.00) Electric Field at point P due to Electric Dipole (V) = 0 An electrical dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges separated by a small distance. The dipole moment is a vector quantity that points from the negative charge to the positive charge and has a magnitude equal to the product of the magnitude of one of the charges and the distance between them. Electrical dipoles are used in a variety of applications, including: The electric field due to the dipole with center at the origin, can be obtained readily as
