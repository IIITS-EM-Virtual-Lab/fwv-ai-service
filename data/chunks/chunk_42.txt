Two Vectors A and B are said to be orthogonal (or perpendicular ) with each other if A.B = 0 The Cross product of two vectors A and B, written as A×B, is a vector quantity whose magnitude is the area of the parallelogram formed by A and B and is in the direction of advance of a right handed screw as A is turned into B. Cross product is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space. It results in a vector that is perpendicular to both vectors. The Vector product of two vectors, a and b, is denoted by A × B. Its resultant vector is perpendicular to A and B. where aₙ is a unit vector normal to the plane containing A and B. The vector multiplication of A × B in the above equation is called cross product owing to the cross sign; it is also called vector product because the result is a vector. If A=(A1, A2, A3) and B=(B1, B2, B3), then
