Resultant Vector of Cross Product: + 0.00 î + 0.00 ĵ + 0.00 k̂
When two vectors A and B are multiplied, the result is either a scalar or a vector depending how they are multiplied. Thus there are two types of multiplication.
The dot product is one way of multiplying two or more vectors. The resultant of the dot product of vectors is a scalar quantity. Thus, the dot product is also known as a scalar product. Algebraically, It is the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of two sequences of numbers.
The dot product of two vectors A and B, written as A.B, is defined geometrically as the product of the magnitudes of A and B and cosine of the smaller angle between them, when they are drawn tail to tail.
where θ is the smaller angle between A and B
Two Vectors A and B are said to be orthogonal (or perpendicular ) with each other if A.B = 0
The Cross product of two vectors A and B, written as A×B, is a vector quantity whose magnitude is the area of the parallelogram formed by A and B and is in the direction of advance of a right handed screw as A is turned into B.
Cross product is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space. It results in a vector that is perpendicular to both vectors. The Vector product of two vectors, a and b, is denoted by A × B. Its resultant vector is perpendicular to A and B.
where aₙ is a unit vector normal to the plane containing A and B.
The vector multiplication of A × B in the above equation is called cross product owing to the cross sign; it is also called vector product because the result is a vector. If A=(A1, A2, A3) and B=(B1, B2, B3), then
