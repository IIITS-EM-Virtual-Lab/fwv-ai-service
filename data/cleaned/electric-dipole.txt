Electric Field at point P due to Electric Dipole (E) = (1.61, 0.00, 0.00)
Electric Field at point P due to Electric Dipole (V) = 0
An electrical dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges separated by a small distance. The dipole moment is a vector quantity that points from the negative charge to the positive charge and has a magnitude equal to the product of the magnitude of one of the charges and the distance between them.
Electrical dipoles are used in a variety of applications, including:
The electric field due to the dipole with center at the origin, can be obtained readily as
Electric flux lines, also known as electric field lines, visually represent the direction and strength of an electric field in space.
