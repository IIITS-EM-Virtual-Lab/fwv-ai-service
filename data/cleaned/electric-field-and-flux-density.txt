Electric flux is defined as the total number of electric lines of force emanating from a charged body. An electric field is represented by electric flux.
We can write the Electric Flux Density Ψ in terms of D
Electric Flux Density is measured in coulombs per square meter. The electric flux density is also called as Electric displacement.
For a volume charge distributions, eqs are
