Coulomb's Law describes the electrostatic interaction between electrically charged particles. It states that the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Coulombs Law:Coulombs Law states that the force F between two point charges Q1 and Q2 Directly proportional to the product of the charges Inversely proportional to the square of the distance R between them where k is the proportionally constant whose value depends on the choice of system of units. In SI units charges are in coulombs (C), the distance R is in meters (m), and the force F is in newtons (N) so that. The constant is known as the permittivity of free space and has the value
