Electrical potential, often referred to as voltage, is the measure of the electric potential energy per unit charge at a specific point in an electric field. In simpler terms, it's the force that pushes electric charges along a pathway. Higher voltage means more potential energy available to move charges, while lower voltage means less. Voltage is essential for powering electronic devices and enabling the flow of electricity in circuits. From Coulomb's law, the force on Q is F = QE so that the work done in displacing the charge by dl is The negative sign indicates that the work is done by an external agent, thus the work done or the potential energy required is If the field is due to a point charge Q located at the origin, then If the point charge Q is not located at the origin but at a point whose position vector is , the potential V(x, y, z) or simply V(r) at r becomes
