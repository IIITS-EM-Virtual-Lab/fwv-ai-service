Ampère's Law can be used to determine H for symmetrical current distributions, much like how Gauss's Law is applied. We will consider: An infinitely long coaxial transmission line. For an infinite current sheet in the plane z = 0 with a uniform surface current density K (A/m): Amperian Path (p): Use a rectangular loop that crosses the sheet symmetrically, with segments above and below the sheet. Choosing a concentric circular Amperian path ensures H is constant if K is constant. Since this path encloses the entire current I, Ampère's law applies directly.
