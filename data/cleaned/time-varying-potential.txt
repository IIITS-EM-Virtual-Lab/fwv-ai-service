The concept of time-varying potentials is a cornerstone of Maxwell's equations, as it provides the foundation for understanding electromagnetic wave propagation. According to Sadiku's Elements of Electromagnetics, time-varying potentials are directly linked to the dynamic behavior of electric and magnetic fields.
In Maxwell's equations, the electric and magnetic fields are expressed in terms of the scalar potential
This inclusion of time-varying potentials enables the prediction of electromagnetic waves, which propagate through space at the speed of light—an achievement that unified electricity and magnetism in a single theoretical framework.
Sadiku emphasizes that these potentials have physical significance, describing the dynamic coupling between the fields, essential for understanding electromagnetic radiation and wave phenomena.
