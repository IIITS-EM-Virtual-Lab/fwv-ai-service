All sections of the Gaussian surface should be chosen so that they are either parallel or perpendicular to E.
|E| should be constant on each surface having non-zero flux.
At all points on the spherical surface, the vector associated with the infinitesimal surface element dA will point in the same direction as the electric field at that point, i.e., radially outward. Thus, the integrand of the surface integral for evaluating electric flux reduces from E · dA to E dA.
Since the sphere is centered about the charge, each point on the surface is equidistant from the center. Hence, the electric field can be moved outside the integral, and the surface integral reduces to the product of the electric field and the surface area of the sphere.
To apply Gauss' Law, we choose a cylindrical surface of radius a along the z-axis, which is symmetric with the charge distribution. Initially, consider a finite cylinder of length l. For the infinite case, we take the limit as l → ∞.
An infinite plane sheet of charge carries a uniformly distributed positive charge with surface charge density σ, defined as the charge per unit area:σ = q/A. Using Gauss' Law, the electric field is calculated as:
Consider a uniform spherical distribution of charge (held in an insulator). The charge density is uniform throughout the sphere. Using Gauss' Law:
