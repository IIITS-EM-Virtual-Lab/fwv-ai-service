High-frequency aliasing fix: when many cycles are visible, the H curve switches to a thin, semi-transparent solid. At moderate cycles the dash spacing increases. This avoids the “vertical blue bars” while preserving information. (a) E, H versus z at t = 0 and (b) E, H versus t at z = 0. For a conductor the green marker shows the skin depth \( \delta = 1/\alpha \). For a lossless dielectric, \( \sigma \approx 0 \), \( \epsilon = \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r \), \( \mu = \mu_0 \mu_r \). Fields are in phase and mutually orthogonal: Set \( \\epsilon = \\epsilon_0,\\ \\mu = \\mu_0,\\ \\sigma=0\\).
