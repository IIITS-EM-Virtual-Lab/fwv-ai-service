Ampère's Law states that the line integral of the magnetic field H around any closed loop is equal to the total current enclosed by that loop. Ampère's Law (in Terms of Magnetic Field Intensity H) Ampère's law is similar to Gauss's law, as it is most easily applied to determine H when the current distribution is symmetrical. Although the equation always holds regardless of symmetry, it is practically useful only when symmetry exists. Ampère's law is a special case of the Biot-Savart law. By applying Stokes's theorem to the left-hand side of the equation, we obtain: Comparing the surface integrals in the above equations gives us further insights.
