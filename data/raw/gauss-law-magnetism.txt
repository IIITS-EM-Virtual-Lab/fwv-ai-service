Magnetic Flux (Φ): 0.00e+0 Wb (Gauss Law → 0)
Gauss's Law for Magnetism is one of Maxwell's equations that describes the behavior of magnetic fields. It fundamentally states that magnetic monopoles do not exist; in other words, there are no isolated "magnetic charges" analogous to electric charges.
Gauss's Law for Magnetism in Differential and Integral Forms
The general statement of Gauss's Law for Magnetism can be expressed in both integral and differential forms.
B ⋅ dS represents the magnetic flux through an infinitesimal area dS on the surface.
∇⋅B represents the divergence of the magnetic field.
Gauss's Law for Magnetism, ∇⋅B = 0, is a fundamental principle of electromagnetism. It reinforces the continuous, loop-like nature of magnetic fields and the absence of magnetic monopoles. This law has been confirmed by all experimental evidence to date and is crucial to understanding magnetic fields and their behavior in various physical contexts.
