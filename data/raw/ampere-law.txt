Ampère's Law states that the line integral of the magnetic field H around any closed loop is equal to the total current enclosed by that loop.
Ampère's Law (in Terms of Magnetic Field Intensity H)
Ampère's law is similar to Gauss's law, as it is most easily applied to determine H when the current distribution is symmetrical. Although the equation always holds regardless of symmetry, it is practically useful only when symmetry exists. Ampère's law is a special case of the Biot-Savart law.
By applying Stokes's theorem to the left-hand side of the equation, we obtain:
Comparing the surface integrals in the above equations gives us further insights.
Ampère's Law can be used to determine H for symmetrical current distributions, much like how Gauss's Law is applied. We will consider:
An infinitely long coaxial transmission line.
For an infinite current sheet in the plane z = 0 with a uniform surface current density K (A/m):
Amperian Path (p): Use a rectangular loop that crosses the sheet symmetrically, with segments above and below the sheet.
Choosing a concentric circular Amperian path ensures H is constant if K is constant. Since this path encloses the entire current I, Ampère's law applies directly.
B. Infinitely Long Coaxial Transmission Line
Consider an infinitely long coaxial transmission line with:
An inner conductor of radius a carrying a current I in the +z-direction.
An outer cylindrical conductor with an inner radius b and outer radius c, carrying a current I in the −z-direction.
For this configuration, we examine the magnetic field H in three regions:
Between the inner and outer conductors (a < r < b).
If the current I is uniformly distributed across the cross-sectional area of the inner conductor, then:
In this region, the enclosed current is I, and Ampère's Law becomes:
So, in the region between the conductors:
Since the currents in the inner and outer conductors are equal and opposite, the total enclosed current for any radius r > c is zero. By Ampère's Law:
Thus, outside the coaxial transmission line:
