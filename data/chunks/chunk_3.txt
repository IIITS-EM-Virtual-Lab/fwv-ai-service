Between the inner and outer conductors (a < r < b). If the current I is uniformly distributed across the cross-sectional area of the inner conductor, then: In this region, the enclosed current is I, and Ampère's Law becomes: So, in the region between the conductors: Since the currents in the inner and outer conductors are equal and opposite, the total enclosed current for any radius r > c is zero. By Ampère's Law:
