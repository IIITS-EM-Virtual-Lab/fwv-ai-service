SCALAR, a physical quantity that is completely described by its magnitude.
Ex: Quantities such as time, mass, distance, temperature, entropy, electric potential, population are scalars.
VECTOR, a physical quantity that has both magnitude and direction.
Ex: Force, velocity, displacement, acceleration, etc.
To distinguish between a scalar and a vector, it is customary to represent a vector by a letter with an arrow on top, such as A̅ and B̅, or by a letter in boldface type such as **A** and **B**.
A vector V has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of V is a scalar written as V or |V|. A unit vector **v** along V is defined as a vector whose magnitude is unity (i.e., 1) and its direction is along V, that is:
A vector V in Cartesian (or rectangular) coordinates may be represented as:
