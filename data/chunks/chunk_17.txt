2. Moving Loop in a Static Magnetic Field (Motional EMF) When a loop moves in a static magnetic field, charges within the loop experience a force due to the field, generating an EMF. The Lorentz force acting on a charge is: This leads to the motional electric field: 3. Moving Loop in a Time-Varying Magnetic Field In this case, both the loop is moving, and the magnetic field is changing with time. This induces both motional EMF and transformer EMF, leading to the total EMF:
