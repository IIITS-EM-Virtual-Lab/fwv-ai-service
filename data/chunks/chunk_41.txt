Resultant Vector of Cross Product: + 0.00 î + 0.00 ĵ + 0.00 k̂ When two vectors A and B are multiplied, the result is either a scalar or a vector depending how they are multiplied. Thus there are two types of multiplication. The dot product is one way of multiplying two or more vectors. The resultant of the dot product of vectors is a scalar quantity. Thus, the dot product is also known as a scalar product. Algebraically, It is the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of two sequences of numbers. The dot product of two vectors A and B, written as A.B, is defined geometrically as the product of the magnitudes of A and B and cosine of the smaller angle between them, when they are drawn tail to tail. where θ is the smaller angle between A and B
