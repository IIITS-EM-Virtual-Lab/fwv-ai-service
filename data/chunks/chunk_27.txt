SCALAR, a physical quantity that is completely described by its magnitude. Ex: Quantities such as time, mass, distance, temperature, entropy, electric potential, population are scalars. VECTOR, a physical quantity that has both magnitude and direction. Ex: Force, velocity, displacement, acceleration, etc. To distinguish between a scalar and a vector, it is customary to represent a vector by a letter with an arrow on top, such as A̅ and B̅, or by a letter in boldface type such as **A** and **B**.
