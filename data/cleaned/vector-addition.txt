Resultant Vector: + 3.00 î + 3.00 ĵ + 3.00 k̂
Two Vectors A and B can be added together to give another vector C; that is
Vector addition is the process of combining two or more vectors to create a new vector called the resultant vector.
The vector addition is carried out component by component. Thus, if
Resultant Vector: + 1.00 î + 1.00 ĵ + 1.00 k̂
Vector subtraction is the process of finding a new vector by taking away the components of one vector from the corresponding components of another vector.
Vector subtraction is similarly carried as
The three basic laws of algebra obeyed by any given vectors A, B, and C, summarized as follows:
