Resultant Vector of Vector Triple Product: + 0.00 î + 0.00 ĵ + 0.00 k̂
Scalar triple product is the dot product of a vector with the cross product of two other vectors, i.e., if a, b, c are three vectors, then their scalar triple product is a · (b × c). It is also commonly known as the triple scalar product, box product, and mixed product.
Given three vectors A,B and C, we define the scalar triple product as
obtained in cyclic permutation. If A.(B × C) is the volume of a parallelepiped having A,B, and C as edges and is easily obtained by finding the determinant of the 3× 3 matrix formed by A,B and C; that is
The result of this vector multiplication is scalar.
The cross-product of the vectors such as a × (b × c) and (a × b) × c is known as the vector triple product of a, b, c.
For Vectors A,B and C, we define the vector triple product as
Vector triple product is recognized as a vector quantity. a × (b × c) ≠ (a × b) × c
which may remembered as the "bac - cab" rule. It should be noted that
