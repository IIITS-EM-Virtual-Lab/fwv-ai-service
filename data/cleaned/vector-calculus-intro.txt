Differential elements in length ,area, and volume are useful in Vector Calculus, They are defined in the Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems. These concepts are fundamental to understanding vector calculus and its applications in various fields, such as physics, engineering, and mathematics.
We notice that the differential displacement dl at the point S is the vector from point S(x ,y, z) to point B(x + dx, y + dy, z + dz)
2.Differential normal surface area is given by
