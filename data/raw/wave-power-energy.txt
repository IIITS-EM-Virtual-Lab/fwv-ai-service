∇⋅(A×B)=B⋅(∇×A)−A⋅(∇×B), and collect terms:
S=E×H. RHS: decrease of stored energy densities
Total power leaving a volume equals the rate of decrease of stored field energy minus Ohmic power dissipated.
Instantaneous power density (W/m²). For time-harmonic fields:
Adjust E₀, f, α, |η|, θη, and σ. Green = instantaneous
Tip: switch to Lossy and increase α to see the envelope decay. Adjust θη to see why ⟨S⟩ scales with cos θη.
