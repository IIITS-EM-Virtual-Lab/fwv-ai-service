Faraday's Law is one of the four Maxwell's equations, which form the foundation of classical electromagnetism. It describes how a changing magnetic field can induce an electric field, which is the principle behind electromagnetic induction.
The general statement of Faraday's Law can be given in both integral and differential forms.
Using Stokes' theorem, Faraday's Law in differential form is:
1. Stationary Loop in a Time-Varying Magnetic Field (Transformer EMF)
In this case, the loop is fixed in space, but the magnetic field through it changes with time. According to Faraday's Law, this induces an EMF:
2. Moving Loop in a Static Magnetic Field (Motional EMF)
When a loop moves in a static magnetic field, charges within the loop experience a force due to the field, generating an EMF. The Lorentz force acting on a charge is:
This leads to the motional electric field:
3. Moving Loop in a Time-Varying Magnetic Field
In this case, both the loop is moving, and the magnetic field is changing with time. This induces both motional EMF and transformer EMF, leading to the total EMF:
